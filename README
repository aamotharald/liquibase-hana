Liquibase extension that provides support for  SAP Hana DB.

Initial Hana DB support is currently implemented in the 2.0.x and 3.0.x branches. The master branch at the moment follows 3.0.x.

The original Liquibase distribution is available at: https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase/

The official liquibase site is: http://www.liquibase.org

Released under the Apache 2.0 License with no guarantee whatsoever.


The 2.0.x branch is built against Liquibase 2.0.5, the 3.0.x branch against version 3.0.2 of Liquibase.

This is work in progress, currently used in a project I am working on. Branch 2.0.x has definitely undergone more testing.
If you give it a go, I'd like to know how it worked for you.

The following generators are currently implemented (please keep in mind Hana limitations for some operations while using them):

AddColumnGenerator
AddDefaultValueGenerator
AlterSequenceGenerator
CreateIndexGenerator
CreateSequenceGenerator
CreateTableGenerator
CreateViewGenerator
DropColumnGenerator
DropIndexGenerator
DropPrimaryKeyGenerator
DropSequenceGenerator
DropTableGenerator
DropUniqueConstraintGenerator
DropViewGenerator
GetViewDefinitionGenerator
RenameColumnGenerator
RenameTableGenerator
SetNullableGenerator

Foreign Keys related generators are not implemented yet. They are still available, as all the other features through sql changesets.
